# Jarvis Symfony Edition
Welcome to the Jarvis Symfony Edition - a fully-functional Jarvis application that you can use as the skeleton for your web applications.

## What's inside?

The Jarvis Symfony Edition is configured this way:

* Application code is stored in ``/src`` folder;
* Public assets (*available from outside*) have to be put inside ``web`` folder;
* Application configuration is available inside ``/app/config.php``;
* Templates can be found in ``/src/views`` folder;
* Commands can be found in ``/src/commands`` folder;

Because I'm a *fan boy*, I embed with this framework the best components and libraries
from the Symfony project:
* Twig: the most powerful templating engine;
* Doctrine DBAL & ORM: probably the best PHP PDO layer & ORM;
* Symfony Console: because I love console commands, and always use it for my projects;

By the way, Jarvis micro framework already use Symfony HttpFoundation and Debug components.

All libraries and skills included in this project are released under the MIT or BSD license.

Happy coding!
